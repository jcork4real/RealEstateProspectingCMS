Real Estate Prospecting Platform CMS


I wanted to learn Bootstrap 4 and figureout how to make my own CMS. I thought it would be fun to create a CMS that people would be able to load and filter potential leads that are filtered from public sources. There is no backend, or functionality yet. Just a frontend at this point.
