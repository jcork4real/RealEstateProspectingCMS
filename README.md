Real Estate Prospecting Platform CMS


I wanted to use Bootstrap 4 to learn how to make my own CMS. Since I have a background in real estate, I thought it would be fun to create a CMS that would be able to load and filter leads from public sources. I am currently just interested in building the UI/frontend at this stage of the process.
